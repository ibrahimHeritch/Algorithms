# Algorithms
A collection of famous algorithms I implemented in java

Just simple one class implementations I made while I was learning these algorithms.

The following are included:

-standard dp solution to the knapsack problem/n

-Computing strongly connected components (SCCs)/n

-Dijkestra's shortest path 

-primm's Minimum Spanning trees
